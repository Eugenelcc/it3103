    "# Lab Exercise: Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common and highly effective approach to deep learning on small image datasets is to leverage a pre-trained network. A pre-trained network \n",
    "is simply a saved network previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image classification task. If this original \n",
    "dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial feature hierarchy learned by the pre-trained network can effectively act as a \n",
    "generic model of our visual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems, even though these \n",
    "new problems might involve completely different classes from those of the original task. For instance, one might train a network on \n",
    "ImageNet (where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects) and then re-purpose this trained network for something as remote as \n",
    "identifying furniture items in images. Such portability of learned features across different problems is a key advantage of deep learning \n",
    "compared to many older shallow learning approaches, and it makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will consider a large convnet trained on the ImageNet dataset (1.4 million labeled images and 1000 different classes). \n",
    "ImageNet contains many animal classes, including different species of cats and dogs, and we can thus expect to perform very well on our cat \n",
    "vs. dog classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the VGG16 architecture. Although it is a bit of an older model, far from the current state of the art and somewhat heavier than many other recent \n",
    "models, we chose it because its architecture is similar to what you are already familiar with, and easy to understand without introducing \n",
    "any new concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to leverage a pre-trained network: *feature extraction* and *fine-tuning*. We will cover both of them. Let's start with \n",

    "## Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction consists of using the representations learned by a previous network to extract interesting features from new samples. \n",
    "These features are then run through a new classifier, which is trained from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw previously, convnets used for image classification comprise two parts: they start with a series of pooling and convolution \n",
    "layers, and they end with a densely-connected classifier. The first part is called the \"convolutional base\" of the model. In the case of \n",
    "convnets, \"feature extraction\" will simply consist of taking the convolutional base of a previously-trained network, running the new data \n",
    "through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "![swapping FC classifiers](https://nyp-aicourse.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/resources/it3103/swapping_fc_classifier.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why only reuse the convolutional base? Could we reuse the densely-connected classifier as well? In general, it should be avoided. The \n",
    "reason is simply that the representations learned by the convolutional base are likely to be more generic and therefore more reusable: the \n",
    "feature maps of a convnet are presence maps of generic concepts over a picture, which is likely to be useful regardless of the computer \n",
    "vision problem at hand. On the other end, the representations learned by the classifier will necessarily be very specific to the set of \n",
    "classes that the model was trained on -- they will only contain information about the presence probability of this or that class in the \n",
    "entire picture. Additionally, representations found in densely-connected layers no longer contain any information about _where_ objects are \n",
    "located in the input image: these layers get rid of the notion of space, whereas the object location is still described by convolutional \n",
    "feature maps. For problems where object location matters, densely-connected features would be largely useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the level of generality (and therefore reusability) of the representations extracted by specific convolution layers depends on \n",
    "the depth of the layer in the model. Layers that come earlier in the model extract local, highly generic feature maps (such as visual \n",
    "edges, colors, and textures), while layers higher-up extract more abstract concepts (such as \"cat ear\" or \"dog eye\"). So if your new \n",
    "dataset differs a lot from the dataset that the original model was trained on, you may be better off using only the first few layers of the \n",
    "model to do feature extraction, rather than using the entire convolutional base.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since the ImageNet class set did contain multiple dog and cat classes, it is likely that it would be beneficial to reuse the \n",
    "information contained in the densely-connected layers of the original model. However, we will chose not to, in order to cover the more \n",
    "general case where the class set of the new problem does not overlap with the class set of the original model."
