## Tensorflow Playground 

### Task 1

Use ![dataset2](images/dataset2.png) as data set

Choose X1 and X2 as input features and choose Linear activation function. Use a single neuron (in a single layer). 
- Can the network classify the data points? 
- Increase the neurons in a single layer. What happens? 
- Increase the number of layers. What happens?
